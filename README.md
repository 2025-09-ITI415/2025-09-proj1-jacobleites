The siren is wailing, the apocalypse is here. You're sealed inside this cramped shelter, the metal groaning as asteroid strikes shake the ground around you. But you have a chance. Blast those big space-rocks! Each shattered fragment reveals a star, a piece of raw cosmic energy. They're your only hope. Collect them all, or perish.
